* Update dependencies

## v0.6.0
* Restructured project to drop the calamine dependency for end users, profile
  generation is now done in a separate private crate
* Update calamine dependency (evensolberg)
* Refactor profile decoding module to be functional and not create large "info" structures
* Implement new decoding options to cover additional use cases
* Improve component expansion to use a nom-like call chain to avoid loops and clones
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.105.00

## v0.5.1
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.89.00

## v0.5.0
* Use Arc instead of Rc to make FitObjects fully thread-safe (danielalvsaaker)
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.78.00

## v0.4.3
* Upgrade nom parser to version 7.0
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.67.00
* Clippy/Typo cleanup (by danielalvsaaker, xehpuk)
* Add doc comments to field types and messages (by xehpuk)
* Allow CRC validation to be skipped.
* Properly handle FIT files where the header CRC is zero (credit ddboline)
* Check that field size and base type are an even multiple of each other

## v0.4.2
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.54.01

## v0.4.1
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.53.00

## v0.4.0
* Improve parser error handling so that the user gets the byte position
where parsing failed instead of the number of bytes remaining
* Expand public API to expose more low level deserialization objects.
* Use an Rc<...> to hold definition messages to avoid unnecessary copying.
* Provide an interface that allows a continuous stream of data in addition
to batch processing (see examples/streaming.rs).
* Implement CRC validation of both the header and data sections.
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.47.00


## v0.3.0
* Refactor the internal de-serialization and decoding logic.
* Return better errors when data buffer is incomplete
* Add the FIT Profile version to the profile module as a constant
* Add a script to regenerate the profile module from a new SDK
* Bump packaged FIT SDK version to 21.40.00

## v0.2.0
* Improve the API to allow manipulating the data with less cloning
* Expose the actual MesgNum enum value to the user in the `kind` field
of each FitDataRecord instead of its name.
* Upated FitDataRecord to store fields as a Vec, sorted by definition
number. Each field contains the name, number, value and units (if defined).
* Rewrote parser logic to more closely resemble how serde deserializers are
typically implemented.
* Added formal error handling so the code should no longer panic anywhere
* Removed the FitFile struct, instead the parser returns a vector of
FitDataRecord objects.
* Moved the `fit_dump` executable to examples and renamed it `fit_to_json`,
this was done to remove the library's dependency on serde_json and structopt.
* Reimplement the `parse` top level function as `from_reader` using the new
return type.

## v0.1.1
Fixed a parsing error when handling string data fields that caused the
parser to panic.

## v0.1.0
Initial release on crates.io.
